# make readable

A minimal self-hostable frontend for [@mozilla/readability](https://github.com/mozilla/readability).

This was made for cases where your browser may not have a built-in reader mode (for example, Firefox Focus users).

## Usage

A demo instance is available at [r3ad.deno.dev](https://r3ad.deno.dev/).

To use, simply append a url in the address bar like so: `https://r3ad.deno.dev/https://kevinfiol.com/blog/getting-rid-of-the-credential-helper-selector-on-git-for-windows/`.
